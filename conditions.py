# print the table of 2

# for i in range(2, 22, 2):
#     print(i)

# print the number : from 2 to 49
# for i in range(1, 50):

# for loop applied on list and set also

# a = ["aadi", "kanha", "ashu", "aisha"]

# 🐍🐍🐍🐍 while loop: make sure to false while loop condition otherwise it will cause infinite loop

# i = 0  # Initialize i with 0

# while(i <= 7):  # Loop runs while i is less than or equal to 7
#     print(i)  # Print current value of i
#     i += 1  # Increment i by 1 in each iteration, otherwise above print run forever becuase i is not incresing (infinite loop)

# print("end")  # This runs after the loop ends


# 🐍🐍🐍🐍 continue statement : it will escape the current iteration and move to next one

# i = 0
# while(i <= 50):
#     if i == 45:
#         i += 1  # Increment BEFORE continue
#         continue  # Skip printing 45
    
#     print(i)
#     i += 1  # Regular increment

# print('end')

#  🐍🐍🐍🐍 break stement : it will jump out of the loop

# i = 0
# while(i <= 5):
#     if(i==4) :
#         i += 1 # runs before break
#         break # jump out of the loop and not check the other upcoming conditions
#     print(i)
#     i += 1
# print('end')
